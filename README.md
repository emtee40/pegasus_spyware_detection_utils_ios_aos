# Pegasus ID
>#### Spyware Identification Utilities - iOS & Android OS
>#### Version 1.0 beta
>#### Author: Jonathan Scott @jonathandata1
>#### Date: October 24th, 2021
## Overview
#### After extensive research and understanding of how Pegasus Spyware is operating inside of iOS and Android OS systems I have created tools that will be able to identify & validate the presence of the spyware on mobile devices, and tablets. Initial detection points were derived from the mvt-project. https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt

#### These tools do not require your android device to be rooted and you do not have to take a full backup of your iOS device.
